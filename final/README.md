# Nate's Portfolio

Hello! I walked into this class wanting to make a portfolio for myself and I am happy with the work I have put in to make this one!

## Link

Assuming this project works (it does not work on Render as I am writing this):
[Website Link](https://csc336-fall2025-7sef.onrender.com)

## External Libraries

The external library I used for this site was [emailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/tutorial/overview/). I used it so I can get emails directly from the website (it works which is so cool!)

## For Dr. Treanor

It has been lovely to be in your class this semester. I really appreciate how much time and dedication you've put into to teaching us and making us feel empowered. Have a wonderful break and a better new year. P.S. Right now my backend is causing issues on render. If I solve them, I'm sorry my backend is held together by bubble gum and a dream, if I don't I'm sorry it doesn't work. Either way, thank you!
